Hello FusionInventory users and future users,

The FusionInventory team will be present in Paris (France), the 20 and 21 May 2014, at meeting [SolutionLinux](http://www.solutionslinux.fr/).

The developpers present at the exhibition stand are:

* David Durieux (the 2 days)
* Guillaume Rousse (the 21 only)
* Kevin Roy (the 2 days)

So if you want to speak agent developpment, prefer come the 21 instead the 20.

For people come on stand, we will offer a very nice FusionInventory gobelet:
