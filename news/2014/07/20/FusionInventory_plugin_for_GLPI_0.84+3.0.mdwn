========================================

The FusionInventory plugin for GLPI maintainers (ddurieux and kiniou)
are glad to announce the 0.84+3.0 release.

You can download it from [the forge](http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-for-glpi/files) and read installation instructions from [documentation](http://www.fusioninventory.org/documentation/fi4g/installation).

This version brings the following new features:

* [GENERAL] Remove the use of mcrypt PHP extension which are obsolete

  not defined use port defined in general option

It also fix many bugs, see [changelog](http://forge.fusioninventory.org/versions/181) for details.

Last, it also provides better performances, and our small test setup is able to
process 13.2 computer inventories per second.

We are already working on next version for GLPI 0.85, with the following
features:

* possibility to lock a field for an item type
* automatic deletion of agent after X days without contacting the server
* selection of SNMP authentications and ordering for network discovery
* tasks rewrite (not finished)
* cleanup remaining references to SNMP models

We're also working on a REST API for a universal FusionInventory server. More
info in a few months.
