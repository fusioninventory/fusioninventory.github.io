Last week, FusionInventory.org website has been migrated from
[Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.com) to [Ikiwiki](http://www.ikiwiki.info).

Some year ago, we decide to use DITA XML for documentation and
[Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) for the Website. DITA is to complex for us
without major benefit (complex tool chain, hard to translate, require an XML editor).
Wordpress is a great product, but we were using it only to publish static page time to
time.

So we decide to change the situation to be able to provide an up to date documentation
directly on the website. For this, we are very happy with Ikiwiki:

* We can maintain the documentation directly with Git and a text editor
* Anyone can update documentation/* pages from the Web without any special account
* The [[Markdown syntax|ikiwiki/formatting]] is simple enough
* Tools like [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) exist to convert or generate Markdown
from different formats (HTML, ODT, DOC, etc).

_We are looking for people willing to help us for the documentation_:

* You did a tutorial for your company and want to share it.
* You want to fix some issues with the current documentation.
* You are a translator?
