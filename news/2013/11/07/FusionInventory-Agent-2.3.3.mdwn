This release fix some bugs in network inventory with some specific devices
(timeout issues, crashes with multiple vlans), and a bug in local inventory on
Windows 64bits (missing 32bits softwares). It also provides a new feature,
backported from future 2.4 version, which is better device identification in
network discovery (more details in a future news).

We did our best to provide a solid release, please [[contact us|/resources]] is
