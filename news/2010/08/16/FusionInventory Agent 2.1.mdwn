# FusionInventory Agent 2.1!

<strong>This is the first release of FusionInventory Agent with Windows support!</strong>

This is the first Windows agent for OCS Inventory that support <strong>UTF-8</strong> and <strong>64bit</strong> software inventory. We also did a lot of improvement on <strong>MacOSX, HP-UX, Solaris and Linux</strong>.

You can download the archive from CPAN [http://search.cpan.org/~fusinv/](http://search.cpan.org/~fusinv/).

Prebuilt standalone installers are also available as a convenience for other operating systems. Just uncompress the archive and you get an usable agent for your platform [http://prebuilt.fusioninventory.org](http://prebuilt.fusioninventory.org).

More information on the [download page](http://fusioninventory.org/wordpress/download-fusioninventory/).
