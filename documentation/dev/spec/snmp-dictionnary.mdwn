# SNMP Dictionnary

The SNMP dictionnary is a data structure of basic model-specific informations,
mainly intended to identify a device during discovery phase.

It is stored as an XML file on the GLPI server (as
gpli_plugins_directory/fusinvsnmp/tool/discovery.xml), and transmitted to the
agent when needed as part of the discovery request.

## format

Here is a simple DTD:
<!ELEMENT SNMPDISCOVERY (DEVICE*)>
<!ELEMENT DEVICE (SYSDESCR,TYPE,MODELSNMP?,MAC?,DYNMAC?,SERIAL?)>
<!ELEMENT SYSDESCR (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT TYPE (2|3)>
<!ELEMENT MODELSNMP (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT MAC (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT DYNMAC (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT SERIAL (#PCDATA)>

Here are the description for the various elements:
* SYSDESCR: SNMP sysdescr value of the described device
* TYPE: 2 for a printer, 3 for a network equipement
* MODELSNMP: SNMP description model identifier
* MAC:  SNMP oid of the device MAC address
* DYNMAC: ?
* SERIAL: SNMP oid of the device serial number

Problems:
- usage of a numeric value for the type is barely human-readable

## communication

The agent stores a local copy of this dictionnary, and compares its md5sum
value with the one given by the server in its discovery request. When they
differs, the agent aborts the execution of the current task, with an error
status, and notify the server using a DICO element in its reply.

The next time the server send an inventory request to this agent, it
automatically send an updated version of the dictionnary, as a giant string
embedded in its discovery request, and the agent caches it locally.

Problems:
- the current dictionnary update requires two agent execution, server-side context, and is counter-intuitive for the user, whereas the server could immediatly send the updated dictionnary to the agent (http://forge.fusioninventory.org/issues/1034)
- the server doesn't allow dictionnary retrieval outside of a scheduled inventory task, making usage of alternative tools difficult (http://forge.fusioninventory.org/issues/1992)
- the double XML-in-XML encoding is unelegant, whereas the dictionnary could be sent either as an XML fragment, or as a separate download

## local customisation

The dictionnary is stored as a file, which is part of Fusioninventory plugin
for GLPI. Any local modification will be taken account immediatly, but they
will be lost on upgrade.
