# DESCRIPTION

`fusioninventory-agent` is an agent for OCS Inventory server and
FusionInventory for GLPI servers. It creates local inventory of the machines
(hardware and software) and send it to the server. It can also write it
in a local XML file.
This agent is the successor of the former linux\_agent which was released with
OCS 1.01 and prior. It also replaces the Solaris/AIX/BSD unofficial agents.

Supported systems:

- `Windows` (since Windows 2000)
- `GNU/Linux`
- `MacOSX`
- `Solaris`
- `FreeBSD`
- `NetBSD`
- `OpenBSD`
- `AIX`
- `HP-UX`
- `GNU/kFreeBSD`

Minimum perl version: 5.8

The which command on UNIX/Linux/MacOSX system.

Additional mandatory perl modules:

- Digest::MD5
- XML::Simple
- LWP
- Net::IP
- UNIVERSAL::require
- Mac::SysProfile (MacOs only)

Additional optional perl modules:

- Compress::Zlib, for message compression
- HTTP::Daemon, for web interface
- Net::CUPS (v0.60 minimum), for printers detection 
- File::ShareDir, for automatic data directory determination
- Proc::Daemon, for daemon mode (Unix only)

## PROCEDURE

Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

You can also run the agent from the tarball directory. In this case, use
the --devlib flag to load the library from the local directory.

## SYSTEM-SPECIFIC INFORMATIONS

### Solaris

Sun Studio seems to be needed to build the dependency. The generated Makefile
needs gmake to be executed. The default installation will install the binary in
/usr/perl5/5.XXXXX/bin, set you $PATH variable according to that.

On Solaris/SPARC, you must install sneep and record the Serial Number with
it.
Download it from [http://www.sun.com/download/products.xml?id=4304155a](http://www.sun.com/download/products.xml?id=4304155a)

### Windows

If you don't want to use the installer for Windows you can follow the
installation process avalaible there:
[http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-agent/wiki/RunAgentWin32](http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-agent/wiki/RunAgentWin32)

## POST-INSTALLATION

Run ./fusioninventory-agent-config for automatic configuration.

# OCS INVENTORY PROTOCOL

FusionInventory Agent uses OCS Inventory protocol and is compatible with OCS
Inventory server. The agent uses the same protocol with the FusionInventory
For GLPI plugin.

The OCS protocol is basicly an exchange of XML file done over HTTP(S).

## First, The PROLOG

The agent send a first message to give it's ID (DEVICEID). The
server send back to the agent an XML file with a list of parameter. It's the
PROLOG RESP. You can see it if you're in Debug mode.
In this PROLOG, the server send the PROLOG\_FREQ. The agent will use it to
know when it need to contact the server for the next time.

The agent compute the next query date this way:

     PROLOG_FREQ/2+RANDOM(PROLOG_FREQ/2)



## Module execution

The agent will launch each modules and pass the list of options found in the
PROLOG RESP as parameter. The module can send information directly to the
server (inventory, SNMP scan result, etc)

## Windows service or Deamon mode

In deamon mode, the agent wait during a period between the last PROLOG and
PROLOG\_FREQ. If PROLOG\_FREQ is not set, it will use --delaytime value.
The default value is 3600.

# OPTIONS

Most of the options are available in a _short_ form and a _long_ form.  For
example, the two lines below are all equivalent:

    % fusioninventory-agent -s localhost
    % fusioninventory-agent --server localhost

- __\--backend-collect-timeout=SECONDS\_BEFORE\_KILL__

Time before the agent kills modules processing which don't end before the
timeout.

- __\--basevardir__=_DIR_

Indicate the place where the agent should store its files.

- __\--color__

Display color on the terminal. This feature is disabled on Windows.

- __\-d__, __\--daemon__

Launch fusioninventory-agent as daemon in background. Proc::Daemon is needed.

- __\-D__, __\--daemon-no-fork__

Launch fusioninventory-agent in daemon but do fork in background.

- __\--ca-cert-dir__=_PATH_

The directory where public SSL certificates are stored. In general it's
/etc/ssl/certs.

You don't need to copy a public certificate on very agent if your private
key is valide and was been signed by a valide certificate authority.

- __\--ca-cert-file__=_FILE_

The path to the public certificate (e.g: /etc/ssl/certs/cacert.pem). If
\--ca-cert-file is used, --ca-cert-dir is ignored.

You don't need to copy a public certificate on very agent if your private
key is valide and was been signed by a valide certificate authority.

- __\--conf-file__=_FILE_

Load the configuration file from the given location. Ignored on Windows.

On Windows the settings are loaded from the registry. The information are
stored there:
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\FusionInventory-Agent

Or on Windows 64bit machine:
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\FusionInventory-Agent

- __\--debug__

Turn the debug mode on.

- __\--devlib__

This option is designed for the developer. With it enabled,
fusioninventory-agent won't try to load the Backend module installed
on the system. Instead it will scan the ./lib directory.
It may also be useful if you don't want to install the agent on
your system.

This option can only be used as command line argument. It will be
ignored if you set it in a config file or in Windows registry.

- __\--delaytime=SECONDS\_TO\_WAIT__

This option defaults to waiting a random() time between 0 and 3600 before
initially contacting the server assuming NO PROLOG\_FREQ has been set.
Once PROLOG\_FREQ has been set, it uses that number at the top end of
it's random setting. Useful for pre-setting a deployed agent's initial
start time (so you don't jam the server all at once, but don't have to
wait an hour to make sure the deployment worked).

- __\--disable-perllib-envvar__

Do not use PERL5LIB and PERLLIB environment variable to find Perl library
path.

This option can only be used as command line argument. It will be
ignored if you set it in a config file or in Windows registry.

- __\-f__, __\--force__

The agent ask first the server if it should send an inventoroy of the
machine. If the server doesn't know the machine or has outdated
informations, it will request it.
With this option, the agent ignore the server anwser and send an inventory.

- __\--html__

Save the local inventory requested by __\--local__ in HTML.

- __\-i__, __\--info__

Turn the verbose mode on. The flag is ignored if __\--debug__ is enable.

- __\--lazy__

Do not contact the server more than one time during the PROLOG\_FREQ and do
an exit if there is nothing to do. Useful if you want to start the agent
script regulary from the crontab but don't want to overload the server.

- __\-l__, __\--local__=_DIR_

Write an inventory in the _DIR_ directory. A new file will be created if needed.

- __\--logfile__=_FILE_

Log message in _FILE_ and turn off STDERR

- __\--logfile-maxsize__=_FILE_

Max logfile size in MB, default is unlimited. When the max size is reached, the
file is truncated. This is only useful if there is no log rotation mechanism on
the system.

- __\--logger__=_LOGGER:_

The logger you want to use. It can be:

            - Stderr: print the messages directly in the console. Messages are lost in
            daemon mode (__\--daemon__). You can use __\--color__ to turn color mode on.
        - File: log the error in a log file. Please use __\--logfile__ to set the
        location of your log file. __\--logfile__ turns this option on automatically
    - Syslog: use the local syslog server to log the messages.

You can use more than one parameter if you use ',' as delimiter. E.g:

    % fusioinventory-agent --logger=Syslog,Stderr --local=/tmp

- __\--no-deploy__

Disable the software deployment (new module).

- __\--no-esx__

Disable the ESX inventory task.

- __\--no-ocsdeploy__

Disable the software deployment (OCS compatible module).

- __\--no-inventory__

Do not generate inventory.

- __\--no-wakeonlan__

Do not use the wakeonlan.

- __\--no-printer__

Do not inventory the printer.

- __\--no-software__

Do not inventory the software installed on the machine.

- __\--no-p2p__

For OCS Inventory software deployment. Do not use peer 2 peer to download files.

- __\-p__, __\--password__=_PASSWORD_

Use _PASSWORD_ for an HTTP authentification with the server.

- __\-P__, __\--proxy__=_PROXY_

Use _PROXY_ to specify a proxy HTTP server. By default, the agent uses
HTTP\_PROXY environment variable.

- __\-r__, __\--realm__=_REALM_

Use _REALM_ for an HTTP authentification with the server. For example, the
value can be 'Restricted Area'. You can find it in the login popup of your
Internet browser.

if no realm is passed and the auth fails, the agent will retry an authentification
with the realm returned by the server.

- __\--rpc-ip__=_IP_

The IP address of the interface to use for the P2P exchange. The default
is 'all' the IP addresses with a 255.255.255.0 mask except 127.0.0.1.

- __\--rpc-port__=_PORT_

The PORT of the interface to use for the embedded HTTP server used for the
peer to peer data exchange and remote control. The default
is '62354'.

- __\--rpc-trust-localhost__

Allow local users to access to http://127.0.0.1:62354/now to force an
inventory immediately.

- __\--scan-homedirs__

Should the agent scan the user directories to inventory their virtual machines ?.

- __\-s__, __\--server__=_URI_

The uri of the server. If _URI_ doesn't start with http:// or https://, the
agent assume the parameter is a hostname and rewrite it like that:

    % --server=http://servername/ocsinventory

If you want to use https or another virtual directory (e.g: /ocsinventory2)
you need to enter the full path.

You can declare more than one server if you use the ',' delimiter.

    % --server=http://servername/ocsinventory,server2

In general, OCS Inventory server URL have this format:

    http://servername/ocsinventory

and FusionInventory for GLPI this one:

    http://servername/glpi/plugins/fusioninventory/front/plugin_fusioninventory.communication.php

__\--server__ is ignored if __\--local__ is in use.

- __\--share-dir__

The directory where are stored the shared files. You probably don't
need this option unless you don't want to use the Makefile.PL installation
procedure or if File::ShareDir is not avalaible.

- __\--stdout__

Print the inventory on stdout.

    % fusioninventory-agent --stdout > /tmp/report.xml
    # prepare an inventory and write it in the /tmp/report.xml file.
    # A file will be created.

- __\--scan-homedirs__

Authorize the agent to scan home directories to help with the Virtual Machines
inventory.

- __\--tag__=_TAG_

Mark the machine with the _TAG_ tag. Once the initial inventory
is accepted by the server this value is ignored and you've to
change the information directly on the server. The server do so
in order to centralize the administration of the machine.

- __\--no-ssl-check__

Do now validate HTTPS certificat with the servers. Please never use this
option in production. This is just a very bad idea.

Hint: you can declare HTTPS\_DEBUG to get SSL error messages in the console.

- __\-u__ _USER_, __\--user__=_USER_

Use _USER_ for the server authentication.

- __\--version__

Print the version and exit.

- __\-w__ _DURATION_, __\--wait__=_DURATION_

Wait during a random period between 0 and DURATION second before initializing
the connexion with the server.

    % fusioninventory-agent --wait 5 --server localhost



# CONFIG FILE

The agent try to initialize the settings from the __agent.cfg__
config file.

It looks for the file in these location:

- /etc/fusioninventory/agent.cfg
- /usr/local/etc/fusioninventory/agent.cfg

You can use the __\--conf-file=XXX__ parameter to load you own configuration
file from a specific location.
On Windows the settings are loaded from the Registry. The configuration file
is ignored.

The command line parameters overwrite the configuration file.

# SECURITY

Some modules like SNMPQuery needs to sent credential from the agent to the
agent. We recommend to enable HTTPS support on the OCS or FusionInventory
For GLPI server. We also recommend to use only trusted machine as agent in
this case.
