## curl

You can also use curl to push an inventory. This can be useful for example if your perl installation has no SSL support and so you can not use the fusioninventory-injector command with a HTTPS only server:

    curl --header "Content-Type: Application/x-compress" --cacert your-ca.pem -u username:password --data @/tmp/lazer.local-2011-10-04-12-21-23.ocs https://glpi/plugins/fusioninventory/

With no SSL check  and no authentification :

    curl --header "Content-Type: Application/x-compress" -k --data @/tmp/monposte.local-2012-10-04-12-21-23.ocs https://myglpiserver/plugins/fusioninventory/
