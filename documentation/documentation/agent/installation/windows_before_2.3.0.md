# Windows installation

## Get the installer

First, download the archive: <http://prebuilt.fusioninventory.org/stable/windows-i386/>

The file name convention is:

* fusioninventory-agent_windows-i386_
* FusionInventory Agent version (e.g: 2.2.5)
* a *-* (dash)
* the package revision. e.g: 2, for the 2nd installer generated for the 2.2.5 release
* .exe

The installer can be used either on 32 or 64 bit Windows.

## Settings

A common mistake is to mix HTTP and HTTPS in URL.

## Advanced settings

![](/documentation/documentation/agent/installation/windows-installer-settings-2.png)

1. Enter here an optional HTTP login and password. This is unrelated with GLPI.
2. Enter the full path to you certificat file. This is important only if you use HTTPS. 
3. This check box will disable the HTTPS certificat check.
4. You can configure here a HTTP proxy. For example, proxy:3128
5. This is the port of the HTTP service of the agent. You need to change it on the server too.
6. This check box will increase *a lot* the verbosity of the agent. The log is available in the agent-log.txt file.
7. The installer can configure the Firewall for you if you want to allow connection on RPC port.

[[!template  id=info text="""
Agent HTTP service is optional. It is only required if you want
to be able to awake your agent to for an inventory or a job.

## Usage

To pass the parameters, do for example:

    fusioninventory-agent_windows-i386_2.x.x-1.exe /S /debug /runnow /server=https://server1/glpi/plugins/fusioninventory/

this mean that i want to install fusioninventory in silent mode, run an inventory after installation, and send the inventory by https

    fusioninventory-agent_windows-i386_2.x.x-1.exe /S /debug /runnow /server=http://server1/glpi/plugins/fusioninventory/

The same as above but with a plain http connection

And installation directory of the agent can be changed via command-line as below:

    fusioninventory-agent_windows-i386_2.x.x-1.exe /S "/installdir=C:\Program Files\FusInv"
Edit
Upgrade with FusionInventory Deploy

If you upgrade the agent with FusionInventory Deploy and the agent is launched with a Service, you will need an agent > 2.2.0-2 and the /execmode=none parameter. This way, the agent won't remove or add service or update the Tasks Scheduler setting. So you will keep the previous settings.

# Large installation

A page is dedicated to explain how to [[deploy the agent on a Windows domain|documentation/agent/installation/windows/large_install]].


# Installation from sources

If you are an developer, or an advanced user, you can also install FusionInventory [[from sources|documentation/agent/dev/git_windows]].
