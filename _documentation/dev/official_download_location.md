# Where should we publish new files

** This document is for FI developers **

Please use the [Get]({{ site.baseurl }}/get/) page to download new release.

Today different places are used to publish files. This situation
is confusing. This document present what should be done in the
futur.

## Today

* prebuilt.f.o
* CPAN
* different projects on the forge
* SF.net
* debian.f.o
* OBS (<http://build.opensuse.org>)

The problems :

* Stable release can be download from various location, this is confusing.
* Development and package snapshot are publish at the same place.

## Draft

We can use download.f.o or the forge.

### download.f.o

* pros
    * simple to manage
    * can be used by debian.f.o to
* cons
    * no downlaod counters (so far)
    * need to define the file hierachie
    * yet another anonical download localisation

### Forge.f.o

* pros
    * already partially in use
* cons
    * complexe to use with different packages IMO (Gon√©ri)
