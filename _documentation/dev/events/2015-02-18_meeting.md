# Development roadmap

## Short term

Ensure the current agent version (2.3.x) works correctly with the GLPI plugin 0.85+1.0 (ie fix bug #2852)

## Medium term

Ensure the next agent major version (2.4.x) is able to get rid of legacy prolog dialog with GLPI plugin 0.85+1.x, while still working with previous GLPI plugin release (including 0.85+1.0)

### Agent behaviour

In order to establish the list of scheduled tasks, the agent should:

* issue a getConfig request
* decide if server answer is self-sufficient
* if not, complete it with an additional prolog request

### Server-side getConfig answer enhancement

The server answer for getConfig request:

* should contains all scheduled tasks, not just ESX and Deploy tasks as it does
  with current release (0.85+1.0)
* should contains something to make it identifable by the agent as
  self-sufficient, such as a version number
* should not contain useless references to non-scheduled tasks (ie bug #2860)

### Additional task-specific getJob answer specification

getJobs answer format for modules not using it should be specified:

* inventory (including specific options, ie bug #2847)
* netinventory
* netdiscovery
* wakeonlan

### long term

Ensure the agent uses JSON and REST API exclusively, both for tasks scheduling
and for task results submission.

* task/job model should be consistent in specification and in user interface
* modules result should be specified, taking advantage of format change
  to get rid of OCS format legacy, such as microsoft-specific nomenclature
  (drive, domain, etc...) and concepts confusion (such as network interface vs
  network addresses)
