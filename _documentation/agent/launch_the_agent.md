title: How to run agent
---

# HTTP interface

If the agent is running as a service or a daemon, its web interface should 
be accessible at <http://hostname:62354>.

If the machine connecting to this interface is trusted (see *httpd-trust*
configuration directective in [agent configuration](configuration.html)), a
link will be available to force immediate execution.

# Command line

Agent can also be executed from command line, using either of its multiple
executables (see [agent man pages](man/) for details).

## Windows

Open a command interpreter windows (cmd.exe), with administrator privileges
(*right clic* â†’ *Run as Administrator* on Vista and Seven *Start menu*).

Go in the **c:\Program files\FusionInventory-Agent\perl\bin** (adjust this path depending on your configuration) directory and run:

    # perl fusioninventory-agent

## OS X

Ensure `daemon` key is not defined or false in `agent.cfg`. This key is enabled on OS X default settings (`/opt/fusioninventory-agent/agent.cfg`).

Go in /opt/fusioninventory-agent and run the following command:

    $ sudo /opt/fusioninventory-agent/fusioninventory-agent

See [OS X documentation for further details](installation/macosx/).

## Other

Just run:

    # fusioninventory-agent
