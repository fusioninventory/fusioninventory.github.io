FusionInventory.org website is hosted by <http://www.Branchable.com>. 
They offer [Ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info/) hosting for a reasonable price
and support FreeSoftware (Debian, git-annex, Ikiwiki, Obnam, etc).

2 years ago the [Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/) decided to pay the
bill for 24 months. Again, we want to thank them!

Now the last dollar has been spent and we are looking for people interested in supporting us
financially.

The best would be at least $59.99, to get a one year support. Please [contact us if
you are interested](mailto:goneri@lebouder.net)!

## UPDATE

The people from [Normation](http://www.normation.com/) paid the hosting till 2017 !!!
