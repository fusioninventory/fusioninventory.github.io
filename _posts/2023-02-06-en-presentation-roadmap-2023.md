On January 12, 2023, I have presented the retrospective of 2022 and the roadmap of 2023.

The slides are available in the website section **Presentation**, or directly on the link [presentation retrospective and roadmap 2023](https://fusioninventory.org/presentation/2023/presentation.html).


You will find the detail of the roadmap 2023 and the planning. I put the planning below so that you have the information directly.

The black part is for FusionInventory and the blue part for FusionSuite (I put both on the same roadmap because it is quite related).
