## First talk in France

A large part of the FusionInventory team was present at <a title="rmll.info : FusionInventory: an inventory project" href="http://2010.rmll.info/FusionInventory.html">Libre Software Meeting 2010 in Bordeaux</a> this week. We had a talk just after the talk of <a title="GLPI project" href="http://glpi-project.org">GLPI project</a>, and could present to a large audience, for the first time in France, the result of all the work that has been done in the last months.

We now provide an unique agent running on multiple OSes like Windows, MacOS X, Linux, *BSD, HP-UX. This agent is modular and already can perform serveral tasks like local inventory of computers, network inventory with SNMP, network discovery, remote wake up of computers, remote wake up of the agent, deployment of packages using OCSNG methods. And as the FusionInventory agent is modular, everybody can add his own task. On the server side, a generic library is also on the way to communicate with the agents. This library will be the core of an integration into GLPI.

## Hot new stuff

The first public talk in France was the occasion of releasing new stuff. A Release Canditate of the agent was released some days ago, it was not enough. We made the new logo of the project official. Big up to Mamadi Kaba from <a title="stampdc" href="http://stampdc.com">stampdc.com</a> who created it and worked amazingly fast. The first FusionInventory T-shirts were ready too, and proudly weared by the members of the team and some lucky contributors. We plan to release soon a second edition of this T-shirts, stay tuned !

## Meetings and discussions

This was an extremely rich week of meetings and discussions for everyone. We had all a lot of pleasure to meet our users, our future users, contributors, projects with same engagement like the guys of <a title="Monitoring-fr" href="http://www.monitoring-fr.org/">monitoring-fr.org</a>, <a title="Shinken monitoring" href="http://www.shinken-monitoring.org/">Shinken</a> and <a title="GLPI project" href="http://glpi-project.org">GLPI project</a>. And we're glad we heard people mentionning our project during their talks about <a title="GLPI news between GLPI 0-78 and 0-80" href="http://2010.rmll.info/GLPI-news-between-GLPI-0-78-and-0-80.html">GLPI</a>, <a title="MondoRescue: a powerful and versatile GPL Disaster Recovery solution" href="http://2010.rmll.info/MondoRescue-is-a-powerful-and-versatile-GPL-Disaster-Recovery-solution.html">Mondo Rescue</a>, <a title="Heterogeneous IT asset management with Pulse2" href="http://2010.rmll.info/Nouvelle-traduction-Gestion-de-parcs-informatiques-heterogenes-avec-Pulse2.html">Pulse2</a>, <a title="Intelligent Infrastructure management with GOsa²" href="http://2010.rmll.info/Intelligent-Infrastructure-management-with-GOsa%C2%B2.html">GOsa²</a>, <a title="OPSI : Management and deployment of Windows Desktop, Servers and software" href="http://2010.rmll.info/OPSI-Management-and-deployment-of-Windows-Desktop-Servers-and-software.html">OPSI</a>, <a title="WPKG: Experience feedback in a small company" href="http://2010.rmll.info/WPKG-Experience-feedback-in-a-small-company.html">WPKG</a> ...
