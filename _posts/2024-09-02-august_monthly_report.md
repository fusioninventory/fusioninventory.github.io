This is the monthly report for August 2024.

# Introduction

This is some news regarding the development of FusionInventory (agent and server).

# Crowdfunding

I have taken many times on it, I have finished preparing on August 31, I'm waiting the confirmation from kickstarter (will take couple days) and after I will launch it.

**More information in a dedicated news in the next days for the launch**

# FusionEcosystem label

The *FusionEcosystem* label has been launched this month and I'm preparing to have this label.

It requires to check all features requests and answer/plan them, it's a big work because we have many issues created by users but it's necessary for the project.

This label will give more visibility and control to the community on the project.

If you want more information, you can visit the [web site](https://fusionecosystem.org).

# Agent FusionInventory

The test of the agent is reported, I have made couple checks and too many parties are missed on Windows part to begin a test.

I have planned to write these parts in September. No date for the test, I will see it for the next monthly report.
