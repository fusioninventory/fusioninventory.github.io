The FusionInventory Agent maintainers are glad to announce the 2.3.18 release.

You can download it from the usual places:

* [our github repo for the source distribution](https://github.com/fusioninventory/fusioninventory-agent/releases/tag/2.3.18)
* [tabad repo for the windows distribution](https://github.com/tabad/fusioninventory-agent-windows-installer/releases/tag/2.3.18)
* etc...

See [download instructions](https://documentation.fusioninventory.org/%20FusionInventory_agent/%20%20%20Installation/windows/) for details.

There has been a long delay since 2.3.17 release, almost 9 months. As a consequence, a large number of bug fixes have been accumulated, some of them fixing long-standing issues, such as:

- perl crash issue under Windows
- enhanced windows service mode supporting windows 10
- P2P deploy is now working
- new --tasks & --conf-reload-interval options
- etc...
