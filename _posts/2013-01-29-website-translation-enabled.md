Hi all,

Some weeks ago, we enabled to translation plugin of [Ikiwiki](http://www.ikiwiki.info). The
website can easily be translated and that's already what Emmanuel Le Normand (fr) and
Piotr Adamcio (pl) are working on.

Thanks to them most of the pages are already available in Polish and French :).

If you want to translate FusionInventory, it's easy. You don't even need to create an account! Just
take a look on [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/translation.html).
If you're interested to do some proofreading and improve the documentation, Be bold, it's a wiki!
