# FusionInventory Agent 2.3.16 release

Hello FusionInventory users,

The FusionInventory Agent maintainers are glad to announce the 2.3.16 release.

You can download it from the usual places:

* [the forge](http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-agent/files) for the source distribution
* [the forge](http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-agent-windows-installer/files) for the windows distribution (soon...)
* etc...

See [download instructions](https://forge.fusioninventory.org/documentation/%20FusionInventory_agent/%20%20%20Installation/windows/) for details.

The major change in this release is compatibility with the new message format
used by the FusionInventory for GLPI plugin, when performing multiple network
discovery or network inventory tasks. They are also minor fixes for HyperV
guest machines identification and CPU retrieval in local inventory.

We did our best to provide a solid release, please [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/) if
you believe you find something unexpected.
