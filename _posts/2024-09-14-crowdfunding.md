# I. Introduction

This crowdfunding concerns two projects at the same time:

* FusionInventory
* FusionSuite

The ambitions, and therefore the major works, have already been underway for several months, even several years.

<br/>

# II. Projects

<br>
<br>

# II.1. FusionInventory

FusionInventory has started its transformation.

The agent is being completely rewritten, in RUST language.

The version will be version 3.0.

This agent allows you to perform several operations on your IT equipment:

* automated inventory of computers and servers
* network discovery
* network inventory (switch, printers, etc.) via SNMP
* application deployment & launch of commands, scripts, etc.

This version will be a version compiled in machine language and will be faster, more robust and will avoid having a program interpreted on computers (better in terms of security).

The server part (which controls the agent and/or receives information) was a plugin in GLPI. It has been [abandoned](https://fusioninventory.org/news/2024/03/27/plugin-fusioninventory-gsit-glpi-support-status.html).

There are/will be at least two servers:

* integrated in GSIT (fork of GLPI)
* integrated in FusionSuite (see the following paragraph)

<br/>

# II.2. FusionSuite

FusionSuite is a software, started in 2021 and developed at about 60%.

It is a web & mobile application that allows you to manage:

* its assets: computers, screens, tables, cars, rockets... (you choose what you want to manage)
* ITIL: support tickets, changes...
* security: CVE of applications

A fairly advanced configurable workflow will also be part of it, allowing operations to be carried out via internal or external triggers.

# III. What will this funding be used for

Currently, I am working on these 2 projects in my free time.

It is frustrating, because I cannot go as fast as I would like.

This funding will allow me to work 100% on these 2 projects for 1 year and therefore to do long sessions of coding or writing documentation; this will save a lot of time and finish **version 3.0 of FusionInventory** and **version 1.0 of FusionSuite** more quickly.

It will also include the documentation to be written, providing support to the community...

# IV. Where is it happening?
