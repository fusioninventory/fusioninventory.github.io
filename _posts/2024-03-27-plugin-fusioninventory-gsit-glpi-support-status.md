# Introduction

Many of users ask me for the plugin FusionInventory compatible with last versions of GLPI (10.0.12, 10.0.13...).

I share with you the status and the plans for the future.


# Support of GLPI: discontinued

Since the first version of 9.5 of GLPI and for versions 10.0 too, most of the minor versions are unstable and breaks internal/plugin API.

So, to have a functional version of plugin FusionInventory, it requires so many times each month to 'just' work.

You can see the problem on 'official' plugins like Formcreator:

It's a nightmare for developers, and I think it's the same for users want to try to have versions compatible.

# Support of GSIT: supported

[GSIT](https://github.com/DCS-Easyware/gsit) is a fork of GLPI, the main goal is to have a more stable version and more secured.

The plugin for GSIT is supported, the next minor version is planned next weeks.


# Support of FusionSuite: supported

And to finish, the integration of the server into [FusionSuite](https://fusionsuite.org/) continues, the software is not yet released, but the works on it continues, planned this year.
