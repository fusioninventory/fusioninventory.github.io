title: News from plugin FusionInventory for GLPI
---

We're working hard to split the  FusionInventoroy For GLPI plugin (for GLPI 0.78) in serveral plugins. It'll be easier to maintain and become possible to write additionnal modules.

The standard plugins availables will be :

* plugin_fusioninventory : the core and mandatory plugin. Manage communication with the agents
* plugin_fusinvsnmp : SNMP features (discovery and query)
* plugin_fusinvinventory : get and manage inventory sent by the agents directement into glpi
* plugin_fuvinvdeploy : manage package creation and deployment. For the moment, this feature will be limited to OCS Deployement only
