Since few months, we have transfered git repositories (agent, plugins...) on github [https://github.com/fusioninventory/](https://github.com/fusioninventory/).

Since few days, we have transfered the issues of the plugin FusionInventory for GLPI (only it for the moment) on github.

So, to open new issue on plugin FusionInventory for GLPI, please open an [issue](https://github.com/fusioninventory/fusioninventory-for-glpi/issues) on github repository.

Last thing, the releases of plugin FusionInventory for GLPI will be available only on github release page: [releases page](https://github.com/fusioninventory/fusioninventory-for-glpi/releases)
