title: Developer code documentation of plugin FusionInventory for GLPI
---

Always in doing best quality code, we have many unit tests and now we have documentation of the code.

You can find the [code documentation here](http://fusioninventory.org/documentation/dev/plugin_doc_code/index.html).

I have taken more than 2 weeks to complete the code documentation (about 30% missing), bu now it's documented to 100% of the code.

The documentation if generated for master branch (so for the 9.1+1.0 version of plugin FusionInventory).

Now try to finish the last features for this next major release ;)
