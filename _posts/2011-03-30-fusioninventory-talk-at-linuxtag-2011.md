[LinuxTag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinuxTag) in Berlin is a major FreeSoftware event in Europe. Members of the FusionInventory and GLPI teams will there.

The talk is [scheduled for the 11th of may.](http://www.linuxtag.org/2011/de/program/freies-vortragsprogramm/popup/mittwoch-11-mai.html). Some of us will be in Berlin the day before.  This talk will be given just one day before the one at Solutions Linux in Paris. It a bit sad to see two major European event like that during the same week :(.
