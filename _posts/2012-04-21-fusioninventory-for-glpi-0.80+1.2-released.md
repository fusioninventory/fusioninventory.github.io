The team is proud to introduce FusionInventory for GLPI 0.80+1.2. This new minor release brings a lot of [bug fixes](http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-for-glpi/issues?query_id=16).

A version compatible with GLPI 0.83 is on the way, and a first RC should be release in the coming weeks.

Please note that if have encountered duplicate components and devices it's possible to clean it in the data integrity checks menu where you will find a button 'clean'.
