title: EATON and FusionInventory

[EATON](http://www.eaton.com/) sent us an Eaton 5PX to help us support it in FusionInventory.

This is a great news for the UPS users. We will be able to speed up a lot the [nut](http://www.networkupstools.org/) integration in FusionInventory and GLPI.

Thanks to them and especially Arnaud Quette!
