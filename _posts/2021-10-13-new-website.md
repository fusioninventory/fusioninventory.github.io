I'm worked since few months on a new website design.

It's always Jekyll and same system, but with a better design and so better to navigate and read.

The content is the same.

I have unified at the best the contact ways to discuss between us all. Now, we use a [discord server](https://discord.gg/APsfqaZA) that replace the forums, IRC and telegram. **So come on say hello !**
