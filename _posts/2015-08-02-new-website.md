Hello FusionInventory users,

this is the new website of FusionInventory.

The website is now hosted by github, the sources are available on the [repository](https://github.com/fusioninventory/fusioninventory.github.io).

On each page, you have buttons under the title. You can used them to:

* Edit (edit + pull-request) the page on github (only for documentation pages)
* Report an issue of a problem on the page
* Share on social networks (Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+ for the moment)

Like you see, we have new design and the FusionInventory logo is back ;)

Thanks for report problems is you see some of them ;)
