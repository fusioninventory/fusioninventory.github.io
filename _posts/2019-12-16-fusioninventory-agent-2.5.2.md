Since last 2.5.1 release, many bug fixes and enhancements have been accumulated, such as:

For the core:
- Few fixes has been addressed for the new integrated HTTP server:
 - Included HTTP server now support IPv6
 - the service can stop it self if the remote client closes a connection before the agent.
 - keep-alive support is now working as expected: the agent default page is now loading
   more efficiently
 - Proxy server plugin now support to fork requests to permit more simultaneous inventory requests
   (10 max forks by default, can be changed is dedicated configuration file)
- Persistent internal datas can now be used to force a inventory (used in win32 installer
  to support /runnow from the service). This also could be used to reset the agent deviceid.
  We added --set-forcerun option support to fusioninventory-agent script to handle this feature.
- on win32, the service is now guaranty to stop in 10 seconds max.
- few fixes around configuration reload has been adresses.
- as important feature: we limited the next run delay reduction:
 - limit next run random delay reduction to max 1/6 of the delay if server delay time is less than 6 hours,
 - limit to max an hour for a delay from 6 hours to 24 hours,
 - and limit to max 1/24 of the delay for delay greater than a day.
  This would keep enough delay randomization to avoid mass agent server connection and
  keep next seen run more coherent with the requested delay.
