The monitoring-fr team made an interview of people from the Eyes Of Network community. EON is a software appliance grouping OpenSource tools acting in the domain of supervision.

They describe FusionInventory as a major block in the implementation of a monitoring and CMDB solution.

Here are the translation of some excerpts from their interview :
<blockquote>Jean-Philippe : About FusionInventory, our objective is of course to use the association with GLPI, but also to make easier the implementation of monitoring and, on the long term, of the CMDB.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Michael : About FusionInventory, it's clearly a major block in the adoption of a CMDB [...] the challenge for the version 3 i very high and we will need innovations like FusionInventory to have the most practical answer for our users.</blockquote>
<blockquote>SÃ©bastien : Shinken as FusionInventory are very interesting and deserve to be studied and tested. The world of  monitoring moves, innovates, we must take it into account and no stay "closed".</blockquote>
