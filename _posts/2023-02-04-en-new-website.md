title: New website for 2023
categories: news

The new website is available for all.

I have reworked the menu and information displayed to be more efficient.

In the main menu, I have added: 

 * **download** section: files and versions are better displayed.
 * **presentation** section: display all presentations of the project.

Why a new site?

It's the same as [FusionSuite](https://fusionsuite.org) and it will be easier to maintain the two websites in same time (and soon a third) with same system. Modify or write news will be faster and will save me time!


In preparation, the translation of the website will deployed in 2023, but not yet know when.
