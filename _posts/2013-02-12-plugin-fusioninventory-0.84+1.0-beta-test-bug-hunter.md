title: FusionInventory for GLPI 0.84+1.0 beta test - bug hunter
---

GLPI 0.84 version is now in beta test, see this post in [GLPI forum](http://www.glpi-project.org/forum/search.php?search_id=1785690941).

So we begin FusionInventory beta test for plugin FusionInventory for GLPI 0.84+1.0 and open the bug hunting season ;)

See these information:

* First *Backup your data*

* Get the last version, download a development archive from [github](https://github.com/fusinv/fusioninventory-for-glpi/archive/master.zip) or use the [git]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/dev/git.html) mirror with [github FusionInventory for GLPI repository](https://github.com/fusinv/fusioninventory-for-glpi), *master* branch. Rename the folder unzipped 'fusioninventory-for-glpi-master' to 'fusioninventory'.

* You have now only one plugin 'fusioninventory' to put in glpi/plugins/ folder and the webservice plugin is not necessary for deployment.

* To report a bug, create an account on [forge](http://forge.fusioninventory.org) and open a bug with this [page](http://forge.fusioninventory.org/projects/fusioninventory-for-glpi/issues/new). Don't forget to specify the target version: **0.84+1.0-BETA**

* The user have opened the most bugs at the end of the hunter bug period will win a **Raspberry Pi** (yes we love free software!)
