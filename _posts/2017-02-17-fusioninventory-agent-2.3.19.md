The FusionInventory Agent maintainers are proud to announce the 2.3.19 release.

You can download sources or dedicated installer from the our github releases page:

* [fusioninventory-agent github releases](https://github.com/fusioninventory/fusioninventory-agent/releases/tag/2.3.19)

See [download instructions](https://documentation.fusioninventory.org/%20FusionInventory_agent/%20%20%20Installation/windows/) for details.

There has been a long delay since 2.3.18 release, almost 9 months. As a consequence, a lot of bug fixes and enhancements have been accumulated, such as:

- better stability and very ligth memory footprint under Windows
- Audits in Deploy task upadted as v2.2 to better report agent status during
  checks and deployments. You'll need a FusionInventory for GLPI plugin update
  to fully benfefits from this update.
- updated & reworked monitors inventory
- virtualization/container detection updates: docker, HyperV, VMWare, KVM, LXC/LXD, VirtualBox
- TeamViewerID support (Linux, Win32, MacOS X)
- Hostid support (Linux, Solaris)
- pci & usb included databases update
- update dmidecode to v3.0 in windows installer
- etc...
