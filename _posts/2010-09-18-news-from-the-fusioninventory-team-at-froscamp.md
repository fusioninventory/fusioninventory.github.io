title: News from the FusionInventory team at FrOSCamp
---

A large part of the FusionInventory team has made the move at [FrOSCAmp](http://froscamp.org) in Zurich, Switzerland, thanks to Mathieu Simon who organized our venue and is a wonderful local support. We could present the project new features, now that the [agent version 2.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/2010/08/16/fusioninventory-agent-2.1.html) and the [plugin for GLPI version 2.2.2.html]({{ site.baseurl }}/2010/08/24/fusioninventory-for-glpi-plugin-in-2.2.2.html) have been released. The conference and the booth were places to start lots of discussions. For the team, time to meet for the first time in real life the new contributors. The roadmap for the next version of the agent has been fixed : the efforts on [version 2.2](http://forge.fusioninventory.org/versions/show/2) will be focused on performance and security improvements.
