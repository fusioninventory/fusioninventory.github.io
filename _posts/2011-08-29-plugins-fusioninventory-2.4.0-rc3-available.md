We have released 2.4.0 RC3 version (so release in couple of days :) ).

We have fixed many minor and big bugs and we ask users to test :

* Task scheduler / management
* Rules for import devices
* Wizard



These 3 parts will be modified and require more test before the 2.4.0 release (all unit test pass but perhaps we have forgotten something to test :p).

Thanks you to users reports bugs.
