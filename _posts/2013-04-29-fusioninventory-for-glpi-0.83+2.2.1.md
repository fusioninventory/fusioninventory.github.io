title: FusionInventory for GLPI 0.83+2.2.1
---

Some days ago, we publish a new stable release of FusionInventory for GLPI ( 0.83+2.2.1 ).

* [fusioninventory-for-glpi-metapackage_0.83+2.2.1.tar.gz](http://forge.fusioninventory.org/attachments/download/952/fusioninventory-for-glpi-metapackage_0.83+2.2.1.tar.gz)

This release requires an up to date installation of GLPI 0.83. Please, take a look on the [Installation
and Upgrade documentation](https://documentation.fusioninventory.org/%20FusionInventory_for_GLPI/%20%20Installation%20%26%20update/1.installation/) before the installation.

Once the plugin is up to date, go in _Plugins > FusionInventory > Inventory > Data integrity check_
and use the _Clean_ button to fix a Software inventory issue.
