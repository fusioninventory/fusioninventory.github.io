## About

This is the [Agency Bootstrap theme](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/agency/), converted to a gem-based Jekyll theme with GitHub Pages support.

While this has been done before, [here](https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme), [here](https://github.com/SotiriosVrachas/jekyll-theme-startbootstrap-agency), and [here](https://github.com/laklau/agency-jekyll-theme/), these are outdated and have not been updated or maintained for years. I built this theme from the most recent Bootstrap source.

I also added a lot of new features that go beyond the original theme's capabilities:

- GitHub Pages support
- [template repo][template] to get up and running in minutes
- contact form functionality powered by [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
- custom pages
- 404 page
- legal/Privacy Policy page
- Google Analytics support
- Markdown support
- custom images
- logo support (instead of just title text)
- automatically updating copyright years
- custom navigation bar, even without the header image(s)
- customizable footer
- custom accent color and dark/light colors
- horizontal scrolling support for client section
<!--
- custom colors with automatic gradient generation (coming soon)
- site title logo text font customization (coming soon)
- horizontal scrolling support for portfolio section (coming soon)
- about section (different from the timeline) -->

The Jekyll structure of this theme includes:

- `_portfolio` files - what generate the portfolio grid. YAML front matter handles all the details
- the `page` layout allows custom pages, as seen in the legal and 404 pages
- `sitetext.yml` enables complete customization of all site text
- `navigation.yml` enables fully customizable navigation
- `style.yml` enables fully customizable colors, background images, and other style-related things
